How to compile and run the C++ program 
To compile and run C++ code, follow these steps:

1. **Write the code**:
   Save your code in a file with a `.cpp` extension, e.g., `program.cpp`.

2. **Choose a compiler**:
   Use a C++ compiler such as 'c×× droid`, C++ compiler.

3. **Compile the code**:
   Open your terminal navigate to the directory containing your file, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   cxx program.cpp -o program
   ```
   This compiles `program.cpp` into an executable file named `program`.

4. **Run the executable**:
   After compiling, execute the program with:
   ```bash
   ./program
   ```
5. **Debugging (optional)**:
   If you encounter errors during compilation, read the error messages carefully to fix issues in your code.And run the program again.
